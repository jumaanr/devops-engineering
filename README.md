From the information you provided, it seems that your LVM setup is fully allocated, and there is no free space in the volume group (`ubuntu-vg`) to extend the logical volume (`ubuntu-lv`). Additionally, the `lsblk` output shows that the physical disk (`sda`) is 300GB, but only 149GB is allocated to the LVM partition (`sda3`). This suggests that there is unallocated space on the disk that can be used to expand your storage.

Let’s break this into two parts:

---

### **1. Check if Additional Storage Was Added**
The IT department mentioned they added more storage. To confirm if the disk size has increased, you can check the disk size using `lsblk` or `fdisk`:

```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
```

Look for the disk size under `/dev/sda`. If the disk size is now larger than 300GB, the additional storage has been added. If it’s still 300GB, the storage has not been provisioned yet, and you’ll need to follow up with the IT department.

---

### **2. Expand the Logical Volume Without Disruption**
If the disk size has increased, you can expand the logical volume without disruption. Here’s how:

#### **Step 1: Resize the Physical Partition (`sda3`)**
1. Check the current partition table:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
   ```

2. Resize the partition (`sda3`) to use the additional space:
   - Run `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`.
   - Delete the `sda3` partition (this does not delete data, as LVM metadata is stored elsewhere).
   - Recreate `sda3` with the same starting sector but a larger size (use all available space).
   - Ensure the partition type is set to `Linux LVM` (hex code `8e`).

3. Update the kernel partition table:
   ```bash
   sudo partprobe /dev/sda
   ```

#### **Step 2: Resize the Physical Volume (`PV`)**
1. Resize the physical volume to use the new space:
   ```bash
   sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
   ```

2. Verify the new size of the physical volume:
   ```bash
   sudo pvdisplay
   ```

#### **Step 3: Extend the Logical Volume (`LV`)**
1. Extend the logical volume to use the additional space:
   ```bash
   sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

2. Resize the filesystem to use the new space:
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

3. Verify the new size:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

### **3. If No Additional Storage Was Added: Free Up Space**
If the disk size has not increased, you’ll need to free up space on the existing filesystem. Here’s a guide:

#### **Step 1: Identify Large Files and Directories**
1. Find large files (e.g., >100MB):
   ```bash
   sudo find / -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
   ```

2. Find large directories:
   ```bash
   sudo du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -h
   ```

#### **Step 2: Clean Up Unnecessary Files**
1. Remove old logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
   ```

2. Clear package manager cache:
   ```bash
   sudo apt clean
   ```

3. Remove unused Docker containers, images, and volumes:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```

4. Delete old snap packages:
   ```bash
   sudo snap remove --purge <package-name>
   ```

#### **Step 3: Monitor Disk Usage**
1. Use `ncdu` to analyze disk usage interactively:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ncdu
   ncdu /
   ```

2. Use `df` to monitor free space:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

### **Summary**
- If the disk size has increased, follow the steps to resize the partition, physical volume, and logical volume.
- If the disk size has not increased, free up space by removing unnecessary files and directories.

Yes, I provided a method to resize the disk and expand the LVM setup. However, since the storage is already allocated under `fdisk`, and you want to confirm whether the IT department has added more storage, let’s clarify the steps again in detail.

---

### **Detailed Steps to Resize the Disk and Expand LVM**

#### **Step 1: Confirm Disk Size**
1. Check the current disk size:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
   ```

   Look for the size of `/dev/sda`. If it’s larger than 300GB, the storage has been increased. If not, the storage has not been provisioned yet.

---

#### **Step 2: Resize the Partition (`sda3`)**
If the disk size has increased, you need to resize the partition (`sda3`) to use the additional space. Here’s how:

1. Install `cloud-guest-utils` (if not already installed) to use the `growpart` tool:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install cloud-guest-utils
   ```

2. Resize the partition (`sda3`) to use all available space:
   ```bash
   sudo growpart /dev/sda 3
   ```

   This command will resize the third partition (`sda3`) to use all available space on the disk.

3. Verify the partition size:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
   ```

   You should see that `sda3` now has a larger size.

---

#### **Step 3: Resize the Physical Volume (`PV`)**
1. Resize the physical volume to use the new space:
   ```bash
   sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
   ```

2. Verify the new size of the physical volume:
   ```bash
   sudo pvdisplay
   ```

   You should see additional free space in the `Free PE / Size` field.

---

#### **Step 4: Extend the Logical Volume (`LV`)**
1. Extend the logical volume to use the additional space:
   ```bash
   sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

2. Resize the filesystem to use the new space:
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

3. Verify the new size:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   The `/` filesystem should now show the increased size.

---

### **If the Disk Size Has Not Increased**
If the disk size is still 300GB, the storage has not been provisioned yet. In this case, you’ll need to:

1. Follow up with the IT department to ensure the storage has been added.
2. Once the storage is added, repeat the steps above to resize the partition and expand the LVM.

---

### **Important Notes**
- **Backup Your Data**: Before resizing partitions or making changes to the disk, ensure you have a backup of your data.
- **No Disruption**: The steps above are non-disruptive and can be performed while the system is running.
- **Verify Disk Size**: Always verify the disk size using `fdisk -l /dev/sda` before proceeding.
